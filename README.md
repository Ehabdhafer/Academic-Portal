## Introduction ðŸ––

#### I've built a dynamic Node.JS app that seamlessly manages Courses. With React powering the frontend, it delivers a fluid user experience, ensuring efficient course management with added security and responsiveness.

## Installation ðŸ’½

Node.JS :

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npx nodemon .\server.js
```

React

```

### Inserting in database:

```
create 2 roles manually from database put this query:
INSERT INTO "Roles" (role,"createdAt","updatedAt")
    VALUES ('Teacher','2024-06-07 18:23:50+03','2024-06-07 18:23:50+03')
	,('Student','2024-06-07 18:23:50+03','2024-06-07 18:23:50+03');
```
